#Cross Validation in Regression problems
#Cross Validation is helpfull in both Classification and Regression problems.
#For classification, we use scoring = 'accuracy' which is a reward function, meaning higher the value it has higher is the accuracy
#For regression, we use scoring = 'neg_mean_squared_error' which is a loss function, meaning higher the value it has lower is the accuracy
